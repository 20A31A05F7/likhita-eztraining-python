FUNCTIONS:

classifications:

1)pre-defined
2)user defined

For code reusability we use functions.
lets say we want to use a particular concept multiple times in our program instead of writing the same code multiple times we can write it once 
include that inside a function and can call the function whereever we need it.

Types:

1)functions without argument without return value
2)without arg with return value
3)with arg with return value
4)with arg without return value


RECURSIVE FUNCTION OR RECURSION METHOD:

A function which calls itself is called recursive function
