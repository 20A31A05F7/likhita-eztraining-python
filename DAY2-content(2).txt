POLYMORPHISM:

--one item or same item used for different purposes 

TYPES:
1)overloading
   -  operator overloading
   - method overloading  
2)overriding :
   If a method is defective or cannot be used inside derived class it will take it from its base classs or parent class.


eg - operator overloading

5+10=15
"5"+"10"=510


DATA STRUCTURES:

helps to write efficient programs
linear - array/ linkedlist/ stack/ queue/ matrix
Non linear - binary tree / heap/ hash table/ graph
linear- storing data sequentially
Non linear-not sequential   

LINEAR
-> static - eg : array
-> dynamic - eg: list, stack, queue

Linked List:
eg: Train
As the name says list of items which are linked with one another is called as linked list.

Types:
singly, doubly, circular

CREATING LINKED LIST
step 1: create a node 
step 2: partition the node with two segments i.e, data and none
step 3: add value into the blank node 
step 4: mark the node as head
step 5: create the next node by following the above steps
step 6: Establish link between first node and second node

DISPLAYING LINKED LIST

Traversal is required from first node till tail node inorder to display existing linked list.
