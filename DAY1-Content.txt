Lambda Function:

  It is called as anonymous function.
 when we want to use  function concept without using function name ,there we apply concept of lambda function.



FOUR PILLARS OF OOPS:

1)Abstraction
2)Encapsulation
3)Inheritance
4)Polymorphism

1)Abstraction:
Hiding the implementation part showing what is required for the users is called as abstraction.
Eg: exe file

We can make class or method as abstract ,opposite to abstract is concrete .
    

2)Encapsulation:
Binding data and function  into a single entity
public-- one class info can be accessed by any other class
private-- can be used where it is declared ?no in inherited class
protected-- can be accessed only where it got declared ... whichever class inherited from this class there also we can use

public--- low level data protection
private--medium level
protected---high level

3)Inheritance:
Base class and derived class
Derived class inherits properties from base class
Derived class - child class
Base class - Parent class

TYPES:
1) single inheritance
2)multiple inheritance
3)Multi-level inheritance
4)Heirarchial inheritance
5)Hybrid inheritance
